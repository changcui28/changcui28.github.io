        <h1>About Chang</h1>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          My name is Chang Cui, student number 141989228, and I am currently a second-semester
          student in the Seneca Computer Programming & Analysis (CPA) program.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I come from China and have lived in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Now, I am
          settled in Toronto, and I love everything about this place.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hold a degree in Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Professional Accounting from
          <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/">Macquarie University</a> in Australia, but my passion
          lies in the field of Computer Programming & Analysis. I am truly passionate about what I
          am currently studying at
          <a href="https://www.senecacollege.ca/home.html">Seneca College</a>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My biggest hobby is road trips. I love the ocean, and I also want to have a dog, either a
          Golden Retriever or a Corgi. I really want one!

        <h1>Why I Chose Animal Crossing</h1>
        <p>
          <br /><br />I first discovered Animal Crossing during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020.
          <br /><br />It became everything for me and my boyfriend during those boring lockdown
          days. The game is very relaxing and doesn't make me too stressed. I love the music,
          visuals, and everything about it. I adore the residents on my island, and I feel like I
          have become friends with them. If I don't play the game for a few days, I miss them a lot.
          <br /><br />So, even though I am busy with my studies now, I visit my old friends on the
          island every few days. I love this adorable game and everything about it!
