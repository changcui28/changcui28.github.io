        <h1>History of Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h1>
        <p>
          Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a social simulation game developed and published by
          Nintendo in 2020 for the Nintendo Switch; it is the fifth main entry in the Animal
          Crossing series. In New Horizons, the player controls a character who moves to a deserted
          island after purchasing a getaway package from Tom Nook, accomplishes assigned tasks, and
          develops the island as they choose. They can gather and craft items, customize the island,
          and develop it into a community of anthropomorphic animals.
          <br />
          <br />
          New Horizons began its development in 2012. The game director, Aya Kyogoku, retained old
          content from previous games to keep fans happy and also ensured that the game was simple
          enough to appeal to newcomers. With art and graphics, the developers used the concept of
          "trigger of play" and the "imagination gap", where the former kept the gameplay simplistic
          and easy to pick up while the latter kept the art style simple for the player to imagine
          the rest. The game was announced at E3 2019 via a Nintendo Direct and after an extended
          development period, released worldwide on March 20, 2020.
          <br />
          <br />
          New Horizons received acclaim from critics, who praised its gameplay and customization
          options and called it the best game in the Animal Crossing series. The game was nominated
          for over a dozen awards and was a contender for Game of the Year. It was a major
          commercial success, selling over 40 million copies worldwide and breaking the console game
          record for most digital units sold in a single month. It is the best-selling game in the
          Animal Crossing series, the second best-selling game on the Nintendo Switch, the
          best-selling game of all time in Japan, and the 14th best-selling video game in history.
          Its commercial success has been attributed in part to its release amid global stay-at-home
          orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The game has been used as a substitute for social
          interactions such as weddings and graduation ceremonies, as well as political campaigning
          and virtual protests. The game also inspired fan creations, such as a trading website, a
          talk show, comics, and merchandise. It received major updates adding new content until
          November 5, 2021.

        <h1>Rules of Gameplay</h1>
        <p>
          As in previous Animal Crossing games, New Horizons is a life simulation game played in
          real time. Weather also adjusts to the seasons of the Northern or Southern Hemisphere,
          depending on the player's real-world location, a first for the Animal Crossing series. The
          game follows a villager customized by the player, who, after purchasing a getaway package
          from Tom Nook, moves into a deserted island. After Tom Nook gives the player essentials,
          such as a tent, the game proceeds in a non-linear fashion, allowing the player to play the
          game as they choose with only a small amount of limitations which lessen as the player
          progresses.
          <br />
          <br />
          The player is given open access to natural resources such as fruit and wood, which can be
          collected and crafted into a variety of items and furniture known as D.I.Y. crafting.
          Alongside this, they can catch bugs and fish, plant and grow trees and flowers, extract
          natural resources such as rocks, and swim in the ocean. The island gives open space for
          placing items and decorating as the player chooses. Certain content available, such as
          organisms, are season-dependent and only appear for a limited time of the year. Doing
          simple tasks rewards the player with "Nook Miles", which in return can purchase premium
          rewards in Resident Services. The other currency "Bells", a staple in the Animal Crossing
          franchise, can be used to purchase other goods and services. Another feature offered early
          on is the "Dodo Airlines", an airport; through Dodo Airlines, and tickets purchased
          through Nook Miles, the player can visit other vacant islands to harvest resources and
          meet other villagers. The player can invite other villagers they meet to their island if
          they choose.
